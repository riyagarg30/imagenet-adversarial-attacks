## üìò Overview

This project explores the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks using **norm-bounded (‚Ñì‚àû) and spatially-constrained attacks** on a ResNet-34 classifier trained on ImageNet. We implement and evaluate:

- **FGSM** (Fast Gradient Sign Method)
- **PGD** (Projected Gradient Descent with 5 iterations)
- **Patch-based PGD** (32√ó32 local perturbation)

Attacks are evaluated on a 100-class, 500-image ImageNet subset and tested for **transferability** on DenseNet-121.

## üß™ Attack Summary

| **Attack**      | **Top-1 Accuracy (ResNet-34)** | **Top-5 Accuracy** | **Success Rate** |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Clean           | 73.5%                         | 91.2%              | ‚Äî                |
| FGSM (Œµ = 0.02) | 26.9%                         | 49.8%              | 73.1%            |
| PGD-5           | 1.6%                          | 11.4%              | 98.4%            |
| Patch (Œµ = 0.3) | 22.7%                         | 46.4%              | 77.3%            |
